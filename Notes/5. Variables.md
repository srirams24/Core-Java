## Working with Data: Variables and Processing

- Software is designed to solve real-world problems using a virtual-world solution.
- Data is at the core of software development, and processing data is essential.
- Data can be acquired from users or through processing, and it's stored and manipulated in the software.

## Variables: Data Storage Boxes

- Variables are containers used to store data for processing.
- A variable has a name and a value, and it can hold various types of data (numeric, text, etc.).
- Variables are used to temporarily hold data during program execution.
- In Java, variables need to be defined with a specific type before use.

## Strongly Typed Language

- Java is a strongly typed language, meaning variables must have a defined type.
- Types determine the kind of data a variable can hold (e.g., integer, string, etc.).
- Each type has its specific uses and limitations.

## Variable Assignment

- Variables are assigned values using the assignment operator (`=`).
- The assignment operator takes the value from the right side and stores it in the variable on the left side.
- Variables are created by specifying the type, followed by the variable name and the assigned value.

## Printing Data and Processing

- Java's `System.out.println()` is used to print data or variable values to the console.
- Variables can be used in calculations and processing.
- The result of processing can be stored in another variable.

## Example: Adding Variables

1. Define variables using their types, names, and values (e.g., `int num1 = 3`).
2. Create a result variable to store the outcome of processing.
3. Perform calculations using variables (e.g., `result = num1 + num2`).
4. Print the result using `System.out.println()`.

```java
class Hello 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int num1 = 1;
        int num2 = 2;
        int result = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

## Proper Variable Naming

- Variable names should be meaningful and indicate the data they store.
- Names should follow a naming convention (e.g., camelCase).
- Names should avoid reserved words and special characters.

## Compilation and Execution

- Save the code, compile it using `Javac`, and then run it using `Java`.
- Observe the printed output to see the results of variable processing.

## Future Exploration

- Further learning will include different variable types, data manipulation, and control structures for more complex processing.
