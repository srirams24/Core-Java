## **Introduction to Conditional Statements:**

- In this guide, we'll explore conditional statements in programming.
- These statements allow us to make decisions in our code based on certain conditions.
- They determine the flow of execution by branching to different paths depending on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

## **Importance of Conditional Statements:**

- Conditional statements are a crucial part of programming, especially when dealing with artificial intelligence and decision-making processes.
- Even driverless cars like Tesla vehicles use conditional statements to determine actions based on various conditions, such as stopping when an object is detected in front of them.

## **Basic Structure of Conditional Statements:**

- In programming, conditional statements are implemented using constructs like `if` and `else`.
- These constructs control the flow of execution by evaluating conditions and executing specific blocks of code based on the results.

## **Using If-Else Statements:**

- In programming, the `if` statement is used to check a condition. If the condition is `true`, a specific block of code is executed.
- If the condition is `false`, the code inside the `if` block is skipped, and the program continues to the next part.

**Syntax of If-Else Statements:**

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}

```

**Example Code:**
Let's consider an example where we want to print "Hello" if a value `x` is greater than 10. Otherwise, we print "Bye."

```java
class Hello 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int x = 18; // Value of x

        if (x > 10) 
        {
            System.out.println("Hello"); // Executed if x > 10
        } 
        else 
        {
            System.out.println("Bye");   // Executed if x <= 10
        }
        

    }
}
```

## **Nested Conditions:**

- You can also have multiple conditions within the same `if` statement using logical operators like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR).
- For instance, you can check if a value `x` is both greater than 10 and less than or equal to 20.

**Syntax for Multiple Conditions:**

```java
if (condition1 && condition2) {
    // Code to execute if both conditions are true
} else {
    // Code to execute if at least one condition is false
}

```

**Example Code with Nested Conditions:**

```java
class Hello 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int x = 18; // Value of x
        int y = 7;  // Value of y
        
        if (x > 10 && x <= 20) 
        {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        } 

        else 
        {
            System.out.println("Bye");
        }
    }
}
```

## **Conclusion:**

- Conditional statements are essential for making decisions in programming based on conditions.
- They enable us to control the flow of execution and perform different actions depending on the values of variables.
- In the next guide, we'll explore more complex scenarios involving conditional statements.
