# **11. Logical Operators in Java** 

- Logical operators are used in programming to combine multiple conditions or operations that result in either true or false.
- There are three main logical operators: AND, OR, and NOT.
- These operators allow you to create complex conditions and make decisions based on multiple criteria.
1. **AND Operator (`&&`):**
    - The AND operator combines two or more conditions, and the overall result is true only if all the individual conditions are true.
    - If any of the conditions is false, the overall result will be false.
    - **Example code:**
        
        ```java
        class Hello 
        {
            public static void main(String args[])
            {
                int x = 7;
                int y = 5;
                int a = 5;
                int b = 9;
                boolean result = (x > y) && (a > b);
                System.out.println(result);  // Output: false
        
            }
        }
        
        ```
        
2. **OR Operator (`||` ):**
    - The OR operator combines two or more conditions, and the overall result is true if at least one of the individual conditions is true.
    - If all conditions are false, the overall result will be false.
    - **Example code:**
        
        ```java
        class Hello 
        {
            public static void main(String args[])
            {
                int x = 7;
                int y = 5;
                int a = 5;
                int b = 9;
                boolean result = (x > y) || (a > b);
                System.out.println(result);  // Output: true
        
            }
        }
        
        ```
        
3. **NOT Operator (`!` ):**
    - The NOT operator reverses the outcome of a single condition.
    - If the condition is true, the NOT operator makes it false, and if the condition is false, the NOT operator makes it true.
    - **Example code:**
        
        ```java
        class Hello 
        {
            public static void main(String args[])
            {
                int a = 5;
                int b = 9;
                boolean result = !(a > b);
                System.out.println(result);  // Output: true
        
            }
        }
        
        ```
        

## **Short-Circuit Evaluation:**

- Logical operators often employ short-circuit evaluation, which means that as soon as the outcome of the overall expression is determined, the evaluation of the remaining conditions stops.
- This can save time and improve efficiency.

```java
class Hello 
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int x = 7;
        int y = 5;
        int a = 5;
        int b = 9;
        boolean result = (x > y) && (a > b);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: false

    }
}
```

- In this example, the `(x > y)` condition is false, so the second condition `(a > b)` is not evaluated at all, resulting in `false`.
- Because if any of the conditions is false, `AND` the operator results in `false`.
- The same applies to `OR` operator, if any of the condition is `true`, it wonâ€™t evaluate the next conditions and simply result `true`.
