# 8. **Type Conversion and Casting in Java**

## **Introduction to Variables and Types:**

- In the previous guide, we covered how to work with variables in Java.
- Every variable has a name and a data type associated with it.
- For numbers, we have data types like `int`, `float`, `double`, and `long`.
- For characters, we use `char`, for Boolean values, we use `boolean`, and for text, we have `String`.(We will see later)

## **Changing Variable Types:**

- Once a variable is declared with a specific data type, you cannot change its type directly.
- However, you can assign values of one type to another type.

## **Implicit Conversion (Type Promotion):**

- Some type conversions happen automatically, which is called implicit conversion.
- For instance, if you have a byte variable `a` and an int variable `b`, you can assign `a` to `b` without any explicit casting.
- This is because the `int` data type can accommodate the range of `byte`.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
           byte a = 10; //byte a
           int b = a; //  Implicit conversion (promotion) from byte to int
           System.out.println(b); //printing b
        }
    }
    ```
    

## **Explicit Conversion (Casting):**

- When you want to convert a value from one data type to another that doesn't fit directly, you need to use explicit casting.
- This is achieved by specifying the target type in parentheses before the value you want to convert.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
           int a = 10; //byte a
           byte b = (byte) a; // Explicit casting from int 
           System.out.println(b); //printing b
        }
    }
    ```
    

## **Type Conversion and Loss of Precision:**

- Be cautious when converting between types that have different ranges.
- For example, converting from `float` to `int` may result in losing the decimal part of the `float` value.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            float floatValue = 5.6f;
            int intValue = (int) floatValue; // Explicit casting from float to int (loses decimal)
            System.out.println(intValue); //printing intValue
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

**Modulus Operation for Conversions:**

- When converting a value that is out of range for the target data type, the modulus operation is used.
- For instance, if you convert a large `int` value to a `byte`, the value is wrapped around within the range of `byte`.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int largeInt = 257;
            byte smallByte = (byte) largeInt; // The result will be 1 due to modulo operation i.e 257 % 256(byte range) =  1
            System.out.println(smallByte);    //Printing smallByte
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

## **Type Promotion in Expressions:**

- When performing operations involving variables of different types, Java may promote one or more values to a larger data type to avoid data loss.

```java
byte a = 10;
byte b = 20;
int result = a * b; // byte values are promoted to int before multiplication

```

## **Shortcuts for Compilation and Execution:**

- In recent versions of Java, you can compile and run a single Java file using a single command. i.e: `java <filename>`
- However, this shortcut might not work in older versions.

```
java Hello.java

```

ðŸ’¡ Remember that this shortcut is for learning purposes and isn't typically used in professional projects.

## Conclusion:

- By understanding type conversion, casting, and type promotion, you'll be better equipped to manage data types and handle conversions between them in your Java programs.
