# 10. ****Relational Operators****

## **Relational Operators in Java**

- Relational operators are used to compare values and determine their relationships.
- They allow us to check if one value is less than, greater than, equal to, or not equal to another value.
- These operators are commonly used in programming to make decisions based on the comparison results.

Here are some commonly used relational operators:

1. **Less Than (`<`)**: This operator checks if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int x = 5;
            int y = 8;
            boolean result = x < y; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
2. **Greater Than (`>`)**: This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int x = 10;
            int y = 7;
            boolean result = x > y; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
3. **Equal To (`==`)**: This operator checks if the values on both sides are equal. Note that it uses double equal signs for comparison, not a single equal sign which is used for assignment.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int a = 5;
            int b = 5;
            boolean result = a == b; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
4. **Not Equal To (`!=`)**: This operator checks if the values on both sides are not equal.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int p = 7;
            int q = 7;
            boolean result = p != q; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
5. **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: This operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int num1 = 10;
            int num2 = 10;
            boolean result = num1 <= num2; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
6. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: This operator checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
    
    ```java
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            int num1 = 12;
            int num2 = 10;
            boolean result = num1 >= num2; // result is true
            System.out.println(result); // Printing result
    
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Remember that the result of a relational operation is a boolean value (`true` or `false`), which is useful for making decisions in your code based on the comparison outcomes.

## Conclusion:

You can combine these relational operators with other logical operators to create more complex conditions. We will see that in the next guide.
